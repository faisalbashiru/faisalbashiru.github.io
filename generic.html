									<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
									<p>I am Faisal Bashiru, an experienced Data Analyst/Data Engineer for over 5 year, with a goal of becoming a Data Scientist in the field of either healthcare, transportation, finance, or sports.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images\IMG-20191203-WA0009.JPG" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I graduated from Stony Brook University with a Bachelor's degree in Technological Systems Management, and specialized in Information Systems. <br />
								   I own an online-business platform called 'FAISAL ORGANICS', and I partner with Amway, where I sell the best organic plant-based products such as nutrition, personal care, bath & body, energy drinks, vitamins and supplements among others. <br />
								<p>I have earned multiple certifications, including Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, which has helped me improved on my skills, by using software tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, R, and Tableau, among others. <br /></p>  
								   Furthermore, I am working on a brand called 'FAISAL ANALYTICS', an innovational online platform where I post my projects to people (especially the youth between 9 - 20) who are interested in Data Science. This is a source of reference for those who are working on problem-solving projects, and are willing to share their conclusions and recommendations for decision-making. Furthermore, this will give people the opportunity, not only to get good careers, but also have the mindset of being solution-oriented, and apply the knowledge in any real-life situations.   </p>
								<p>The goal is to keep my projects concise, simple, and straightforward and most of my projects are made to be educational and informative. Each project will mostly consist of Python, Excel, SQL, and Tableau. Also, these projects will be arranged chronologically by the 6 Data Analysis Phases. <br /> 
								   Moreover, my projects will have disclaimers and notes so that the viewers will have a clear understanding on how these analysis were made, based on my perspective and based on the data itself. There might be changes where necessary, for future references and technical practices.</p>
